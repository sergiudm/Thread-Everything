# Example Applications
Thread-Everything's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications. Here are a few examples built using the existing plugins:

## Visual Meditation Assistant:

### Problem: Meditators want a distraction-free environment and a way to track their posture without using their phones or alarms.

### Solution: Thread-Everything's vision engine powers a contactless meditation timer with posture correction.

### How it works:

Users set the meditation duration using hand gestures.

During meditation, a Raspberry Pi or Windows machine monitors posture via the camera.

Configurable alerts (e.g., lights) signal poor posture.

A summary email with posture snapshots is sent upon completion.


## Smart Gym - Pace Detection and BGM Control:

### Features:

- Control gym lighting and music using pull-up movements.

- Accurately measure running or elliptical pace using computer vision (more precise than wearables).

- Receive detailed workout reports via email, including snapshots and peak pace.

- Control music playback (next song, play/pause) using hand gestures.

## Anti-Distraction App:

Detects late-night studying (or other distractions) and sends a reminder email.
