## Introduction

[Thread-Everything](https://github.com/sergiudm/Thread-Everything) provides a simple API to integrate any thread(plugin) from different machines with Python scripts. It can help you to manage your threads and communications more efficiently.

For instance:
- Control remote robots with a single windows client.
- Play online games with gestures with your friends.
- Monitor your home with a single server.
- Universal GPIO scheduler, zero code configuration of GPIO levels, killing all kinds of Lab assignments in college.
- Intelligent fitness room, control the music and lights with gestures.

## Features

- Single-function plugin

    Add your own plugin to the system by simply creating a single Python function in the `plugins` directory

- Single-file management

    All the plugins are managed in a single file(`config.json`), which makes it easy to maintain and manage

- Multi-OS support
  
    Thread-Everything supports machines running on different operating systems, including Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and Windows
